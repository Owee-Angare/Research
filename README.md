## Research Projects
### Ongoing 
### •	3D PRINTED SOFT ACTUATOR FOR LEGGED LOCOMOTION
Guide: Dr. Arati V Mulay, Associate Professor, Department of Production Engineering and Industrial Management, COEP.<br> 
The research project aims to conduct an extensive and rigorous literature survey to find optimum material, design and to contruct a prototype of soft actuator used in robotic legged locomotion using a 3D printer. The project also aims to experimentally varify and confirm the results with the results of the optimum design obtained from literature survey.   

### Past
### •	AERIAL VEHICLE 
Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India (Innovation Cell), organized a “Fight Corona Ideathon” across India. This project idea ‘Aerial’ was amongst the top 39 solutions selected from 4500 plus entries. The Aerial Vehicle along with attached robotic linkage is aimed at taking nasal samples of people for COVID19 test, thereby eliminating human to human interaction and safeguarding the medical and support staff.
